abstract: Psychopathy is a personality construct that encompasses a constellation
  of traits reflecting emotional dysfunction and antisocial behavior. This constellation
  has consistently been linked to poor decision-making, often focused on personal
  and monetary gains at the others’ expense. However, there remains a lack of a systematic
  examination of how psychopathy is related to the prospect of obtaining monetary
  gains as a function of social context. Therefore, we conducted a series of meta-analyses
  to elucidate these relationships. Our findings indicated that elevated levels of
  psychopathy are related to a reduced tendency to cooperate with others, and no difference
  in the extent to which knowledge of others’ retaliation possibilities informs decision-making.
  However, the type of social economic decision-making game employed moderated the
  association between psychopathic traits and total gain obtained, suggesting that
  context plays a key role in moderating the link between psychopathic features and
  decision-making. These findings advance our understanding of psychopathy and open
  new avenues for research on adaptive and maladaptive social behavior in individuals
  with high levels of psychopathic traits.
