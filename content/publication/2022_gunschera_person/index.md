abstract: Progress in psychopathy research has been hampered by ongoing contention
  about its fundamental cause. The Impaired Integration theory of psychopathy provides
  an attention-based account of information integration abnormalities. We set out
  to evaluate the suggested mechanism via an innovative application of the well-established
  illusory conjunction paradigm (Treisman & Gelade, 1980). Two hundred participants
  were recruited by utilising a psychopathic-trait-maximisation technique, sampling
  individuals from an ex-prisoner and a population sample. We found no evidence for
  differences in illusory conjunctions suggesting that integration of cues deficits
  in psychopathic individuals (BF10 = 0.156), and the absence of a relationship between
  psychopathic traits and illusory conjunctions remained when accounting for confounding
  variables. These findings question the mechanism proposed by the Impaired Integration
  theory and pave the way for future research to advance our understanding of psychopathic
  trait aetiology by assessing specific and falsifiable mechanisms thought to bring
  about the observed cognitive and behavioural deficits.
