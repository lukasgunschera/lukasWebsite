# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: I am a PhD student at the MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit at the University of Cambridge. My research integrates computational modelling with experimental and longitudinal methods to examine the behavioural and neurocognitive mechanisms connecting social media use and mental health outcomes. I’m particularly interested in identifying factors that contribute to risk and resilience in digital environments, with special attention to addictive behaviour patterns. This work aims to bridge theoretical understanding with practical applications, ultimately informing evidence-based intervention and policy development. I have a background in methodology and statistics and focus on conducting open and reproducible research.
