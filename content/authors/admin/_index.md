# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: I am a PhD student at the MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit at the University of Cambridge. I am particularly interested in the cognitive and social mechanisms that underlie engagement and outcomes of social media use. My research uses a combination of longitudinal and computational approaches to examining the (cognitive) mechanisms implicated in social media use and mental health. I have a background in methodology and statistics and focus on conducting open and reproducible research.
