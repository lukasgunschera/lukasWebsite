I'm an interdisciplinary scientist committed to advancing equity. 

Through varied professional experiences, I've developed a solid foundation of skills across genetics, mathematics, and computer science. These experiences also brought me to UCSF, where I began as a [Biological and Medical Informatics PhD student](https://bmi.ucsf.edu/people/students) in 2024. My research currently focuses on improving standard statistical models for predicting an individual's genetic susceptibility to developing certain diseases (e.g., type 2 diabetes). 

I'm also deeply passionate about science communication and its power to inspire change. Towards the goal of increasing the accessibly of advanced scientific concepts, I've tutored disadvantaged high school students with the Australian South Asian Healthcare Association (ASHA), and [written about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on maternal health](/science-communication) for the Global Health Alliance Australia newsletter. On this webpage I share [code snippets, my learning](/resources), and [teaching resources](/vce-biology) with ... well, technically speaking, the world.
