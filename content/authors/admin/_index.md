# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: I am a PhD Student at the MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit at the University of Cambridge. I am particularly interested in the potential cognitive and social mechanisms that underlie human learning. I utilise a combination of longitudinal and computational modeling to examine the cognitive processes involved in social media use and wellbeing. I have a background in methodology and statistics and focus on conducting open and reproducible research.
