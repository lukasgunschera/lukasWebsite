As an undergraduate student, I really wanted to get involved in research. However, I never found a notice board or social media community that shared these broadly beyond their originating institution. So I often had the frustrating experience of encountering advertising for research opportunities I was excited about right after the application deadline had passed.

These frustrations led me to develop a list of rough deadlines and summarize information for biomedical and bioscience research programs I was interested in. This list prepared me for the next round of applications: adding and checking information on undergraduate research problems deadlines months and even years ahead meant I knew when to start writing up applications.

I was prompted to update this list once again last year when I was approached by an undergraduate student who was trying to find research opportunities. As this list helped me and this student in our quests to get research experience, I decided to also share it below in the hope it might help at least one other Australian student with the same goal!

<details> <summary> <b> Disclaimer: </b>  </summary> 
<br>
The below list is far from complete, so please only use it as a starting point - not a definite source of information. I last checked the accuracy of information and links in June 2023; since this date, the program information (including deadlines) may have changed, or the research program may no longer be running. It's also not comprehensive, so there are undoubtedly more opportunities to discover out there! As I developed it for myself while I was an undergraduate in Melbourne, the below list unsurprisingly focuses on opportunities for Melbourne and undergraduate students. Please consider these limitations when you use this list, and check the program links (and Google if the links have expired) for the latest application deadline, eligibility criteria, and program information.

Now that I've provided you with this declaimer, without further ado, and in no particular order here is the list of research opportunities I developed:
