<h2> Australian South Asian Healthcare Association (ASHA) Lectures </h2> 

I’ve developed the following resources for senior high school students as part of my work with ASHA, a not-for-profit organization that supports disadvantaged students and raises funds for healthcare projects in South Asia. Additional teaching resources for senior high school biology students are available on [my VCE Biology page]({{< relref "/vce-biology" >}}).
