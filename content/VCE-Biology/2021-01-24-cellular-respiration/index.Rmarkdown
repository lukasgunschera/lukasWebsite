<aside>

<b> Note: </b> To develop the content for this page I adapted a learning plan I wrote in 2021 for VCE summer school. It's now better targeted to the 2022-2026 VCAA study design, but it is still not a perfect match for this study design. 

</aside>


<aside>
üí° <b> Associated VCAA (2022-2026) Study Design Dot Points: </b>
<br> <br> 
<ul> <i> 
<li>
the <b> main inputs, outputs and locations </b> of glycolysis, Krebs Cycle and electron transport chain including ATP yield 
</li>
<li>
the <b> location, inputs and the difference in outputs </b> of anaerobic fermentation in animals and yeasts 
</li>
<li>
the <b> factors that affect the rate of cellular respiration </b>:  temperature, glucose availability and oxygen concentration
</li>
</ul></i>
<br>
... this looks like a lot to know - but don't worry, it's actually not at all - it's just boring.           
</aside>

## <span style="color:#D32F2F"> Learning Objectives </span>

*By the end of this lesson you should be able to:* 

- Contrast the purpose of aerobic respiration, anaerobic respiration and photosynthesis
- List the main inputs and outputs for the light dependent and light independent stages of photosynthesis
- List the main inputs, outputs and ATP yields for stages of cellular respiration *(glycolysis, anaerobic respiration, Krebs cycle, electron transport chain in yeast and in animals)*

Bonus objectives:

- Easy: Agree it's ridiculous that life exists given the complexity of reactions it needs (photosynthesis, cellular respiration)
- Challenge: Explain how different factors (temperature,  light, glucose availability, carbon dioxide and oxygen concentration) impact the rate of cellular respiration and photosynthesis

VCAA emphasises that <b> "details of the biochemical pathway mechanisms are not required" </b>

</aside>

What this means that what you really need to know is: WHERE, WHAT GOES IN, WHAT COMES OUT and HOW MUCH ATP for each stage. Sooooo ... let's just focus on these aspects.

### <span style="color:#D32F2F"> Overall cellular respiration equation: </span>

<br> 

Word equation:
$$ \text{Oxygen} + \text{Glucose} + \text{ADP} + \text{Inorganic Phosphorus} ‚Üí \text{Carbon Dioxide} + \text{Water} + \text{ATP (available energy)} $$ 



Chemical equation:

$$ 6O_{2} + C_{6}H_{12}O_{6} + 36ADP + 36P_{i} ‚Üí 6CO_{2} + 6H_{2}O + 36ATP $$
