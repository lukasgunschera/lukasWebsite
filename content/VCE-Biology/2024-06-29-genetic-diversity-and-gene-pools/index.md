## Learning Objectives:

*By the end of this session you should be able to:* 

-  Explain how allele frequencies relate to genetic diversity of a population
-  Predict the direction of change to the level of genetic diversity in a population due to mutation, gene flow, and genetic drift (bottle neck and founder effect)


<aside>
üí° Associated VCAA Study Design Dot Points:               <ul> <i> 
<li> the qualitative treatment of the causes of changing allele frequencies in a population‚Äôs gene pool including types of mutations (point, frameshift, block) as a source of new alleles 
</li>
<li> 
processes of evolution including through the action of mutations and different selection pressures on a fragmented population and subsequent isolating mechanisms (allopatric speciation) that prevent gene flow 
</li>

 **Gene Pool:**

- ‚Äúthe complete set of alleles present in a population‚Äù

**Allele Frequency**

- Incidence or proportion of genes which have a particular allele within a population

**Genetic Diversity**

- Amount of variation within a gene pool
    - *How many different alleles?*
    - *What frequency do the alleles occur?*
