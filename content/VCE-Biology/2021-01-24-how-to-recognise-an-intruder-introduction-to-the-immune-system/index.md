## Antigens

Antigens are:

<ul>
<li> <b> foreign markers </b> (non-self, typically large, complex molecules, usually proteins or glycoproteins on cell surface)
</li> 
<li> <b> which induce an immune response </b> in the body 
</li> 
<li> either alone or </li>
<li> 
after forming a complex with a larger molecule that 
causes the production of antibodies and is capable of binding with an antibody 
</li>
</ul>

The immune system uses antigens to recognise foreign substances as â€˜non-selfâ€™; to know what to attack.

Foreign substances typically come from <b>pathogens</b>.
Pathogens are organisms or infectious particles (cellular or non-cellular agents) that are able to cause disease (disruption to normal functioning) in a host cell.

<br>
<br>
<br>

<b> What does the immune system use to recognise 'self'? </b>

There are specific group of glycoproteins, which are cell surface proteins, that mark a cell as â€˜selfâ€™ (self-antigens). These proteins are called Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC). 

Our cells are able to determine â€˜Selfâ€™ and â€˜Non-selfâ€™ through the presence or absence of self molecules on the surface of the cellular membrane. 

Self-molecules are most important in the adaptive immune system (also known as the specific, or 3rd Line of defence). 

<br>

<b> What protein molecules help the immune system tell if a cell is displaying
self markers or non-self antigens on their surface? </b>

Among our cell surface proteins is a specific group of glycoproteins that mark a cell as â€˜selfâ€™ (self-antigens). 
These proteins are called Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) proteins. 

<ul>
<li>
Class I MHC Markers: 
     <ul>
     <li>
located on the surface of all human cells with a nucleus (i.e. not red blood cells).
     </li>
     <li>
their message is: the molecule I'm displaying should be 'self' 
     </li>
     </ul>
</li>
<li>
Class II MHC Markers: 
      <ul>
      <li>
located on the surface of antigen presenting white blood cells (e.g. macrophages) 
       </li>
       <li>
their message is: the molecule I'm displaying is foreign 
       </li>
       </ul>
</li>
</ul>
<br> 

## What is the difference between an antigen and an allergen?

<ul>
<li>
An <b>allergen is an antigen</b>, but <b>not all antigens are allergens</b>. 
</li>
<li>
An antigen is any substance that's capable of causing your immune system to produce antibodies. 
</li>
<li>
An <b>allergen</b> is any antigen that <b>causes an allergic reaction</b>, which
is a kind of immune reaction (just an aborrant one!)
</li>
<li>
An <b>allergen is typically harmless for most individuals</b>, 
but antigens can come from pathogens which are harmful to their hosts
</li>
</ul>
<br>
<br> 

# The innate immune response

Immune responses are often categorised into:
innate (non-specific) and adaptive (specific).

The innate immune system responds to infection rapidly, 
without needing prior exposure or priming because it is not 
specific to a particular pathogen. 

In this non-specific means it responds the same way
to many different pathogens. For instance, innate immune
responses would respond to different variants of COVID-19 viruses the same way,
and likely be equally as effective across all these variants.
Comparatively, the adaptive immune system would likely be 
less effective when exposed to a new
COVID-19 variant because it is 'specific': cells in this part of the 
immune system are typically designed to recognise only one antigen. 

<br>
<br>

## Barriers

The first line of immunological defence against pathogens are barriers. 
These barriers can be physical, chemical or microbiota.

<details> 
 <summary> Can you list some examples of <b>physical barriers</b> to pathogens 
 trying to infect an <b>animal</b>? </summary>
 
 <ul>
 <li>
 Skin surface
 </li>

 </li>
 </ul>
 
 </details>
 
 
 <details> 
  <summary> What are some examples of <b>chemical barriers</b> to pathogens 
  in <b>animals</b>? </summary>

  </li>
  <li>
  Stomach acids 
  </li>
  <li>
  Sweat (contains salt which absorbs water from cellular pathogens) 
  </li>
  </ul>
  
</details>

## Important players in the innate immune response

<h3 style="color:#D32F2F">  Proteins: </h3>

<b>Complement proteins</b>

Proteins that circulate the plasma in their inactive form.
When they are broken down into smaller components, 
they are able to rapidly trigger a downstream series of reactions that amplify the immune response 
(a process called the 'complement cascade'). 
The complement cascade can be triggered by foreign material, pathogens, 
infected cells and antibody-antigen complexes. 

<details>
 <summary> The complement protein cascade has three main functions: </summary>

<ul>
<li>
<b>Increase phagocytosis</b>: Attach to invading micro-organisms (a process called opsonization), making it easier for phagocytes to engulf these pathogens
</li>
<li>
<b>Lyse cell membranes</b> of fungi and bacteria 
</li>
<li>
<b>Promote inflammation</b> to recruit phagocytes to the area of infection, so they clear pathogens and infected cells
</li>
</ul>

</details>

These functions 'complement' the jobs of the adaptive immune response - 
which is why these proteins are called complement proteins. 
Complement proteins are able to be activated rapidly, 
and rapidly amplify the immune response in infected regions of the body. 

<br>

<b> Interferons </b>

Interferons are anti-viral proteins produced by virally infected cells. 
They are a kind of cytokine: A signalling molecule that regulates immune responses, typically in an autocrine (impacting the cell that secreted the cytokine) or paracrine (impacting nearby cells) manner. 

<details>
<summary>
The three main immune functions of interferons are:
</summary>

<ul>
<li>
Interfere with virus replication
</li>
<li>
Stimulate macrophages and natural killer cells
</li>


</details>


<br>

<h3 style="color:#D32F2F"> Cells: </h3>

<b>Antigen Presenting Cells:</b>

<ul>
<li>
The main role of antigen-presenting cells: <b>engulf foreign particles and 
present fragments of these antigens like "flags" on their cell surface</b>
</li>
<li>
They <b>signal to T-cells and other adaptive immune system cells</b> 
that they are displaying non-self molecules, not
by <b>placing these antigen fragments on 
MHC (Major Histocompatibility Complex) Class II</b> protein molecules 
(you can think of these as the flag poles!)
</li>
<li> 
B lymphocytes, dendritic cells and macrophages are Antigen Presenting Cells.
</li>
</ul>

<br>
<b>Macrophages</b>

Mnemonic device to remember their phagocytotic role is: Code <b>RED</b>.

<ul>
<li>
<b>Antigen Presenting Cell</b>: Display the antigens of ingested pathogens to trigger an adaptive immune response
</li>
<li>
<b>R</b>ecognise, <b>engulf</b> and <b>destroy</b> foreign material
</li>
<li>
Engulf antibody-antigen complex
</li>
</ul>

<br>
<b>Dendritic cells</b>

<ul>
<li>
Important <b>Antigen Presenting Cell</b>
</li>
<li>
Many dendritic cells are tissue-resident dendritic cells:
typically sitting dormant tissues near the surface of the body, 
and grow branched projections ('dendrites') that search their environment for foreign material
</li>
<li>
Once they Code <b>RED</b>: <b>R</b>ecognise, <b>engulf</b> and <b>destroy</b> foreign material,
they travel to the lymph nodes, and present antigen fragments to T-cells and B-cells
</li>
</ul>

<br>
<b>Neutrophils</b>

<ul>
<li>
Most common white blood cell (leukocyte)
</li>
<li>
Are phagocytes so they follow Code <b>RED</b>: 
<b>R</b>ecognise, <b>engulf</b> and <b>destroy</b> foreign material
</li>
<li>
They are granulocytes: cells containing large vesicles of immune regulatory or 
anti-antigen substances 
</li>
<li>
During degranulation, they release anti-microbialsubstances
</li>
</ul>

<br>
<b>Eosinophils</b>

<ul>
<li>
They are granulocytes: cells containing large vesicles of immune regulatory or 
anti-antigen substances 
</li>
<li>
When triggered, they degranulate (release their granules) 
which releases cytokines,
enzymes, and reactive oxygen species.
</li>
<li>
Important in the immune response to parasites (multi-cellular organisms), 
and in allergic responses
</li>
</ul>

<br>
<b>Mast cells</b>

<ul>
<li>
Large resident cells in connective tissue
</li>
<li>
Also a granulocytes: contain many granules of histamines
</li>
<li>
Release histamine when triggered by antigen or 
allergen binding to antibodies (IgE) on their cell surface
(read more about histamine's effects below under 
[Steps in the Inflammatory Response](#steps-in-the-inflammatory-response)
) 
</li>
</ul>

<br>
<b>Natural Killer Cells</b>

<ul>
<li>
Type of lymphocyte (white blood cell, found in the lymphatic system)
</li>
<li>
Attack and kill virally infected cells and cancer cells
</li>
<li>
They kill by sending cytokines instructing infected or cancer cells to apoptose
</li>
</ul>


<br>
<br>

## Steps in the Inflammatory Response

As you will notice in the below, histamine plays a very big role in the inflammatory response. 

The inflammation response is important for preventing or stopping infection when barriers are broken. 

But allergic reactions also trigger the inflammatory response: this is why people experiencing hay fever often take anti-histamine medications! 

<ul>
<li>
Mast cells release histamines 
</li>
<li>
Histamine causes nearby arterioles to expand (inflammation!)
</li>
<li>
Expanded arterioles lead there to be more blood to the region, hence more white blood cells in the area
</li>
<li>
Histamine causes capillaries to become highly permeable
</li>
<li>
Macrophages can pass from the bloodstream to infected tissue more easily
</li>
<li>
Histamine attracts phagocytes (Neutrophils are often the first to travel to the inflamed region)
</li>
<li>
Dead phagocytes form pus 
</li> 
</ul>
