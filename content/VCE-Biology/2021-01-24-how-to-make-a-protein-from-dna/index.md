# Post-transcriptional processing

In Eukaryotic organism, the pre-mRNA molecule must be processed before it can be translated. 
Once post-transcriptional modification is complete, the pre-mRNA is considered 'mature mRNA', and it can leave the nucleus via a nuclear pore.

Post-transcriptional processing is the stage of gene expression that most students neglect to mention in the exam - and it often costs them valuable marks, so don't count yourself among them!

<br>

## Splicing

Splicing is one important step in post-transcriptional processing for Eukaryotic organisms. 

In splicing some parts of the pre-mRNA molecule are excised ('introns'), so others can be joined together ('exons').

A neat trick to help you remember whether introns or exons are the ones that are spliced out of the molecule is to remember the phrase: <b>ex</b>ons get to <b>ex</b>it the nucleus.

<details>  <summary> Explanation </summary>
<br>
Transcription alone will lead to a pre-mRNA molecule that is the same length as the coding section of the gene (meaning - not including any regulatory components of a gene). However, in post-transcriptional processing in Eurkaryotic organisms the pre-mRNA molecule is 'spliced' (ome parts of the pre-mRNA molecule are excised), and lots of As are added to the end. Thus, the processed mRNA molecule that results from this process is no longer the same length as the original sequence coded in the DNA.

# Translation

The process of building a polypeptide molecule from a mRNA molecule. 

The responsibility of ribosomes.

<ul>
<li> the mRNA travels to a ribosome which reads the START codon sequence (encodes for a methionine) </li>
<li> tRNA carry the correct amino acids to the ribosomes </li>
<li> the anticodon on the tRNA is matched to the codon by complementary base pairing </li>
<li> the amino acid on the tRNA is added to the growing polypeptide chain </li>
<li> the tRNA molecule leaves, the ribosome moves a codon along the mRNA molecule </li>
<li> the process repeats until the STOP codon is reached and the ribosomes dissociates from the mRNA molecule. NOTE: It is not a protein at this stage, it needs to undergo modification and folding into its specific 3D shape.
